### The problem
Write a program that allows a user to enter a number, then prints each number between 1 and the user's chosen number (input), but for numbers that divide by 3 print "Fizz" and for numbers that divide by 5 print "Buzz", and for numbers that divide by 3 AND 5, print "FizzBuzz".

The user will input their number via a browser prompt pop-up console.

The output will be a list of numbers from 1 to the input, but: 
- each multiple of 3 is "Fizz"  
- each multiple of 5 is "Buzz" and 
- each multiple of 3 AND 5 is "FizzBuzz".

### Author notes
I chose to use a handwriting-style typeface and light, relatively saturated colours to convey the youthful side of this children's game.

This project features the JavaScript setTimeout() method to make the page feel more interactive for the user.
